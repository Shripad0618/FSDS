Ans: True, False



2. What are the three different types of Boolean operators?
Ans: AND, OR, NOT


3. Make a list of each Boolean operator's truth tables (i.e. every possible combination of Boolean values for the operator and what it evaluate ).
Ans: True and True =  True
False and False =  False
True and False =  False
False and True =  False

True or True =  True
True or False =  True
False or True =  True
False or False =  False


4. What are the values of the following expressions?
(5 > 4) and (3 == 5) 
False


not (5 > 4)
False

(5 > 4) or (3 == 5) 
True

not ((5 > 4) or (3 == 5))
False

(True and True) and (True == False)
False



(not False) or (not True)
True


5. What are the six comparison operators?
> ,<,>=,<=,==,!=


6. How do you tell the difference between the equal to and assignment operators?Describe a
condition and when you would use one.
Ans: difference between equal to and assignment operator is = and == respectively.
= refers assignment operator
== refers equal to




7. Identify the three blocks in this code:

Ans: 
spam = 0
if spam == 10:
    print('eggs') #---------------Block 1
if spam > 5:
    print('bacon')#---------------Block 2
else:
    print('ham')#---------------Block 3
    print('spam')
    print('spam')
    
    
8. Write code that prints Hello if 1 is stored in spam, prints Howdy if 2 is stored in spam, and prints
Greetings! if anything else is stored in spam.

Ans: 
spam = int(input("Enter a integer: "))


if spam == 1 :
    print("Hello")
elif spam == 2:
    print("Howdy")
else:
    print("Greetings")
           
           
           

9.If your programme is stuck in an endless loop, what keys youâ€™ll press?
I,I




10. How can you tell the difference between break and continue?
break will break the loop and will  not undergo futher iteration process
continue will ignore the current ongoing condition of the loop and run with the next itereation


11. In a for loop, what is the difference between range(10), range(0, 10), and range(0, 10, 1)?

Ans: There are no difference. All will print the exact results



12. Write a short program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a for loop. Then write an equivalent
program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a while loop.
Ans:
for i in range(1, 11):
    print(i)


i=0
while i<11:
    i=i+1
    print(i)



13. If you had a function named bacon() inside a module named spam, how would you call it after
importing spam?
